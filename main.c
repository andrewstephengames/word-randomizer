          Please consult the comments from within the
     printUsage function for usage examples and additional
     information in order to better understand the way the
     program was designed.

          The Program uses size_t boolean-like variables 
     in order to determine the command line flags that are 
     to be used by the user. In order to generate the words,
     by default a `words.txt` list of words is included with
     the source code, including the top 500 most commonly used
     English words, according to 
     https://www.smart-words.org/500-most-commonly-used-english-words.html. 
     A custom input file may be provided as well, but the feature
     is experimental currently as it generates issues to do
     with file opening and closing.

     (TODO)
          The plans are to provide a graphical GTK interface,
     as well as to make the program cross platform. It currently
     compiles under Windows just fine, however some features are
     harder to use due to how the command line is handled there.
